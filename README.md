## About Me

I'm a chip design engineer with experience in image sensor architecture design and verification. I'm passionate about technology and how it can be used to make a positive impact on people's lives.

### Current Work

I'm currently working on several exciting areas related to image sensor design:

1. **Sensing-Storaging-Computing Image Sensor**: This technology involves the integration of sensing, storage, and computing functions in an image sensor. The image sensor can perform various operations and computations when readout signals, which greatly reduces the amount of data transferred off-chip, leading to lower power consumption and faster processing speed.

2. **Time and Space Modulate SPAD Sensor**: This is a new type of Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) sensor that can perform time and space modulate operations. It can capture both temporal and spatial information simultaneously, and perform various types of convolution operations in real-time, which has the potential to greatly accelerate certain computer vision algorithms.

3. **Convolution Accelerator**: A novel convolution acceleration technology that uses a 2D-to-1D mapping technique to speed up convolutional operations using neuron circuits and digital ICs. This approach can significantly reduce the computational complexity of convolution operations and thus improve the efficiency of image processing systems.

4. **In-Memory Computing**: In-memory computing is a new paradigm for computing that utilizes memory to perform computations. This approach greatly reduces the data movement between memory and processor, leading to higher energy efficiency and faster processing speed. In my work, I'm exploring the use of SRAM or flash-based memory for in-memory computing to support the new edge of AI applications.

I'm excited about the potential of these technologies to revolutionize image sensing and processing, and I'm constantly exploring new ideas and techniques to further advance these areas.
